Build a full‑stack web app called PlacementPanic – AI Mock Interview Panic Buster.

Goal: Help CS students who panic in interviews by giving them realistic mock interviews, performance analytics, and AI‑style feedback.

Tech stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no React)

Backend: Node.js, Express

Database: MongoDB (use Mongoose)

Auth: JWT + bcrypt password hashing

Core features (MVP, all must be implemented):

User Auth & Profiles

Signup/Login with email + password

Store name, college, year, target role (SDE, Web Dev, etc.)

Protected routes using JWT

Question Bank & Categories

Collections for questions with fields: text, category (DSA, Web, Java, System Design, HR), difficulty (easy/medium/hard)

API to get random questions by category + difficulty

Mock Interview Session

Frontend page: “Start Interview” where user selects: category, difficulty, duration (5/10/15 mins), camera on/off (UI only, no actual video recording required for now)

Show one question at a time, with countdown timer and “Next question” button

Track questions answered, time spent, and a self‑rating slider (1–5) per question

Analytics & Panic Metrics

After each session, compute:

Overall score (avg of self‑ratings)

Difficulty mix, number of questions answered, total duration

Store each session in MongoDB linked to user

Dashboard page:

Total interviews done

Average score

Best score

Simple “panic reduction index” = min(5 × number_of_interviews, 90)

Feedback Generator (no paid AI)

On backend, write a pure JS function that generates textual feedback based on metrics:

High score → positive reinforcement

Low score or few questions → suggest more practice

Show 3 strengths and 3 improvement points

Return this feedback in JSON and render it nicely on frontend.

API Design

/api/auth/signup, /api/auth/login

/api/questions/random?category=&difficulty=&count=

/api/interviews (POST to save a completed session)

/api/interviews/stats (GET dashboard metrics)

Frontend Pages (plain HTML/CSS/JS):

Landing page explaining problem: “92% students fail due to panic, not skills” and CTA “Start Panic Training”

Login/Signup page

Dashboard with stats cards + “Start Interview” button

Live Interview screen with: current question, timer, controls, and basic fake “confidence meter” bar updated by JS

Post‑interview Report page showing metrics and generated feedback.

Project structure required:

server/ folder: index.js, routes/, models/, controllers/, middleware/auth.js, .env.example

public/ folder for static frontend: index.html, login.html, dashboard.html, interview.html, report.html, styles.css, main.js

Use express.static to serve frontend from public/.

Extra requirements:

Use environment variables for DB URL and JWT secret

Include a README.md with clear steps: how to install, run backend, and open frontend

Seed script to insert at least 40–50 interview questions into MongoDB.
